# Introduction

To help the client unlock the potential of financial analysis and reporting, Iâ€™ve analyzed the client's financial data 

The goal of this financial analysis is to analyze whether the client is stable, solvent, liquid, or profitable enough to warrant a monetary investment.

# Problem Statement

Using the client's financial data:
- help the client unlock the potential of analysis and reporting
- produce everything the client need to know about her finances

---

# Data Sourcing

This Datasets were presented by [Finex Skills Hub](https://www.finexskillshub.com) and available at:

# Data Transformation

Data transformation was done in Power Query and the datasets were loaded into Microsoft Excel Power Pivot for modeling.

The client's financial data consists of  2 worksheets containing 2 tables:

- `Transactions` which has `4 columns and 296 rows` of observation
- `Budget` which has `15 columns and 24 rows` of observation



After careful examination each of the tables have same column names, hence:

The tabulation below shows the column names and their description:
| Column Name | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Start | Represents the start date and time of the observation |
| End | Represents the end date and time of the observation |
| Sleep Quality | Represnts the quality of sleep of an individual around a certain time |
| Regularity | Represents the regularity of sleep of an individual  around a certain time |
| Mood | Blank Column |
| Heart Rate(bmp) | Represents the heart rate of an individual  around a certain time |
| Steps | Represents the number of steps taken by an individual in a day |
| Alarm Mode | Describes the alarm mode the individual has set |
| Air Pressure | Represents the air pressure in the room |
| City | Blank Column |
| Movements | Represents the number of movements made by the individual around a certain time |
| Time in Bed | Represents the time in bed in seconds  |
| Time Asleep | Represents the time asleep in seconds |
| Time before sleep | Represents the time before sleep in seconds |
| Window Start | Represents the window start date and time |
| Window Stop | Represents the window stop date and time |
| Did Snore | Describes the snoring sound |
| Snore Time | Represents the snore time of an individual in seconds |
| Weather Temperature | Represents the tempaerature of the weather around a certain time |
| Weather Type | Describes the weather type |
| Notes | Blank Column |

Data Cleaning for the 2 datasets was done in power query as follows:

- Unnecessary columns were removed. The remaining columns were tailored to provide answers to the [Problem Statement](https://github.com/globalsmile/Airline-Analysis#Problem-Statement) and are shown below:

| Column Name |
| ----------- | 
| End | 
| Sleep Quality | 
| Regularity | 
| Time in Bed | 
| Time Asleep | 
| Snore Time |

- Validated the accuracy of the of `End` column by changing the type to `date only`
- Removed error rows from the `End` column

To ensure the accuracy of the dates in the `End` column, a date table was created for referencing using the M-formula:

`List.Dates(#date(2020,01,01), 365*1, #duration(1,0,0,0)`

Here is a breakdown of what the formula does:

For the 2 datasets, we want the start date to reflect the earliest date that we have in the data: January 01, 2020. Additionally, you want to see date for 1 year(time frame for our anlysis), including dates in the future.This approach ensures that, as new observation flows in we won't have to re-create this table.Also the duration represents observation for everyday.

The date table was named `Calender`.

# Data Modeling

After the datasets were cleaned and transformed, it was ready to be modeled.

- The `Calender` table was then marked as the official date table in the dataset.
- To reference the dates in the `End` column of the 2 tables named `Client` and `Partner` respectively more accurately, a `one-to-many (*:1) relationship` was created between the 
`Client` and the `Calender` tables using the dates column in each of the tables, also a `one-to-many (*:1) relationship` was created between the 
`Partner` and the `Calender` tables using the dates column in each of the tables in a `Star Schema` as shown below:

After [Data Visualization](https://github.com/globalsmile/Airline-Analysis#Data-Visualization), the all the columns in both the `Client` and `Partner` tables were hidden.

# Data Visualization

Data visualization for the datasets was done in two folds using Microsft Power BI Desktop and Microsoft PowerPoint:
- `Client Sleeping Habit Analysis`: Shows the average time in bed per day, average time asleep per day, average snore time per day, etc for the client.
- `Partner Sleeping Habit Analysis`: Shows the average time in bed per day, average time asleep per day, average snore time per day, etc for the Partner.

Figure 1 shows visualizations from `Client Sleeping Habit Analysis`

# Data Analysis

Measures used in visualization are:

- Average Regularity = `AVERAGEX(Client,Client[Regularity])`
- Average Sleep Quality = `AVERAGEX(Client,Client[Sleep Quality])`
- Average Time in Bed = `AVERAGEX(Client,Client[Time in bed (seconds)]) / 3600`
- Average Time Asleep = `AVERAGEX(Client,Client[Time asleep (seconds)]) / 3600`
- Average Snore Time = `AVERAGEX(Client,Client[Snore time]) / 60`
- Background Transparency = `"rgba(255,255,255,0)"`

As shown by [Data Visualization](https://github.com/globalsmile/Airline-Analysis#Data-Visualization), It can be deducted that:

- Both the client and partner snores, however the partner(`Average Snore Time = 15 min`)  snores longer than the client(`Average Snore Time = 3`)
- The partner(`Average Time in Bed = 7 hours`) spends more time in bed than the client(`Average Time in Bed = 5 hours`)
- The partner(`Average Time Asleep = 6 hours`) spends more time asleep than the client(`Average Time Asleep = 4hours`)

---

# Insights

As shown by [Data Visualization](https://github.com/globalsmile/Airline-Analysis#Data-Visualization), It can be deducted that:

There is a strong negative correlation between the sleep quality and the snoring time of both the client and partner, hence we can not make any recommendations as to improving the quality of sleep

This can be caused by an overestimation of snoring by the app. For clinical practice, the present results indicate that the app should not be used for OSA screening, but can possibly be a helpful tool for monitoring snoring e.g., inconjunction with the evaluation of different treatment modalities.
